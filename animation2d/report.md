# Assignment 3

## Basic Functionality
The program compiles and implements the follow functionality (80%)
- an animation with one level of transformation hierarchy (moon orbiting cat)
- one (cubic) bezier path (cat is translated around scene along path)
- the Bezier curve may be edited dragging definition points around the scene

## Advanced Functionality
I also implemented the following advanced functionality
- the textures have transparency and are rendered using OpenGL alpha blending (+2%)

## Extras
On top of that
- I architected my code using good object oriented design (+1%)
- I used a Git repository with frequent commits and quality log messages (+1%)
- I documented my code with comments (+1%)
