# Assignment 1

## Basic Functionality (70%)
I implemented everything from this category.

The program compiles and renders
- One sphere
- A single point light source and fixed point of view
- Ray-plane intersection of a given surface material using Phong shading model
- Casting sphere shadows on the plane

## Advanced Functionality (+2%)
I also implemented the following advanced functionality
- Procedural checkerboard texturing

## Extras
On top of that (Arthur told me I could get extra marks for the following)
- I architected my code using good object oriented design (using inheritence, polymorphism, and encapsulation)
- I added the ability to have an arbitrary quantity of point lights and spheres
