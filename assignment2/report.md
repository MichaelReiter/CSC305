# Assignment 2

## Basic Functionality
The program compiles and implements the follow functionality
- Generates triangle meshes from simple primitive shapes (cubes, spheres, and cylinders)
- Writes the meshes to a file format (.obj)
- Reads meshes from .obj files, and displays them

## Advanced Functionality
I also implemented the following advanced functionality
- Generate cone .obj meshes
- Generate pyramid .obj meshes
- Render the meshes using the Phong illumination model

## Extras
On top of that
- I architected my code using good object oriented design, making use of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism
