# Assignment 4

## Basic Functionality
The program compiles and implements the follow functionality (80%)

### Geometry (35%)
- Generate a flat triangular mesh using GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP
- Implement Perlin noise on the CPU
- Generate a heightmap texture using fBm
- Displace the vertices in the vertex shader using the heightmap texture

### Rendering (35%)
- Calculate surface normals and implement diffuse and specular shading
- Texture according the height and slope
- Implement the skybox texture using OpenGL cubemap textures

### Animation (10%)
- Implement basic WASD camera controls

## Advanced Functionality
I also implemented the following advanced functionality
- Textured lakes (flat mesh) using water.png

## Extras
On top of that
- I architected my code using good object oriented design
- I used a Git repository with frequent commits and quality log messages
- I documented my code with comments
